"""Give the process a real stdout/stderr when it was started without one.

Under pythonw.exe (Windows, no console) `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` are None
and file descriptors 1 and 2 are not open; a macOS app started from Finder
writes them to /dev/null. paddle, paddlex and their progress bars write to
both while the models load, and a write to a None stream raises, so the
first OCR would fail -- and nothing would be left to debug a problem with.
`redirect_if_needed()` opens `<data>/logs/ocr-snap.log`
(the previous run's log kept as `ocr-snap.log.1`), dup2()s it onto fds 1
and 2 and rebinds sys.stdout/sys.stderr to it.
