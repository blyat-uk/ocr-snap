"""The app's runtime environment (Qt-free, stdlib only): the data dir, the
portable bundle, and the OCR engine (paddle) a bundle installs on first run.

| Module     | Role |
|------------|------|
| `paths`    | data dir, log file, `$OCR_SNAP_BUNDLE` and bundle.json |
| `gpu`      | the nvidia-smi probe and the pure, table-driven variant choice |
| `engine`   | the engine dir, its state.json, and `activate()` |
| `pip`      | the pip command, its environment, and reading its output |
| `procs`    | running a child process with streamed output and a cancel |
| `checks`   | `python -m ocr_snap.runtime.checks verify|prefetch` (child processes) |
| `install`  | `EngineInstaller`: pip -> verify -> prefetch, GPU -> CPU fallback |
| `logfile`  | sending stdout/stderr to a log file when there is no console |
| `proc`     | the kwargs every child process gets (no console window on Windows) |

Nothing here imports paddle; `activate()` must run before anything does.
